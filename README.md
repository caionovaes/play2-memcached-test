# Play Memcached Test

Minimal test using Play Framework 2.6 and a [Memcached Plugin](https://github.com/mumoshu/play2-memcached).

You need to have memcached installed and running on 127.0.0.1:11211.

It is basically an index page with a status message, an input for the cache and some intuitive buttons.

P.S. There are some http filter configurations.
